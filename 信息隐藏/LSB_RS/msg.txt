If I could save time in a bottle
the first thing that I'd like to do
is to save every day until eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
again I would spend them with you
Windflowers
Windflowers,windflowers
my father told me not to go
near them
He said he feared them always
and he told me that they
carried him away
Windflowers,beartiful
windflowers
I couldn't wait to touch them
to smell them I held them
closely
And now I cannot break away
Their sweet bouquet disappears
like the vapor in the desert
So take a warning ,son
Windflowers ,ancient
windflowers
their beauty capture every
young dreamer
who lingers near them
But ancient windflowers,
I love you
